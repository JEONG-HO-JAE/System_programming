# First Assignment
• Read a file that contains characters only “0” or “1”
    E.g., 0101010101000001010100101111010101000100101010111010101010  
• File name that your program needs to read is “input”  
• Store the data in the memory in each “bit” and represent the data in the file using various data types in C  
• Don’t assume the size of the input file (it can be a huge file)  

## Requirements
• You MUST provide your Makefile  
• We will compile your code using your Makefile with the ‘make’ command  
• You MUST provide only one ‘.c’ file and one ‘.h’ file  
• You MUST provide simple and proper comments on your code  
• Your code MUST prints out the data as decimal numbers  
• When you print the data using float or double types, you MUST print out 4 digits
after the decimal separator (E.g., 12.3456).  
• You MUST print the data through the stdout (e.g., printf()).  
• When you print the data using the char type, you MUST print out the data (as a decimal number) and its corresponding ASCII character (if possible) as well.  
• If there is no ASCII character corresponding the number that you are printing out, you MUST print its ASCII code using a dot “.
